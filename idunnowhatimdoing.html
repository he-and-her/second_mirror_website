I like the idea of doing impossible things.
I like the idea that we can have the future we see in movies now.
I like to try and make it real.
Would you partake?
Contact me.

        <summary>Design Patterns, P1 ~ 2024.08.23 @ 19.50</summary>
        <p>
          How many design patters are? Well, if you read the title of such blog, you probably guess: I have no idea but let's find out.
        </p>
        <p>
          A very passive research, I know very unfair, it says that the book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>
          was so influential that apparently those are the design patterns. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The book focuses on, well, OOP. It says nothing about functional programming. I wonder how that happened, I mean, not why functional programming
          was not included in the book but rather why OOP won the battle (bit dramatic here). Ignoring any hardware limitations, there were, I really
          don't understand why OOP got more popular. I mean, I can guess, functional programming is too <em>math-y</em>, right?
        </p>
        <p>
          The point I'm trying to make is that we as human tend to not to take the high road. Maybe is the path of least effort? I mean
          in a way it is but to what cost?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anywho! I dislike design patterns. In my head, that complexity makes no sense but I didn't know why. I studied them. I memorized them.
          I have to since I'm not a software engineer and I have to compete with actual software engineers. I have always disliked them.
          I code them since the jobs required that but honest to God, bleh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's try to code them in Elixir, my favorite programming language. Let's start with <em>Factory method</em> in Ruby. 
        </p>
        <img src="factory-method-1.png" alt="Factory Method" style="width: calc(100% - 1rem); margin-left: 1rem;" />
        <p>
          The Creator class provides the template method to be used by each class that inherited from it. You can have N different ConcreteCreator
          that do their own magic and so it is the factory method.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now, in Elixir
        </p>
        <img src="factory-method-2.png" alt="Factory Method" style="width: calc(100% - 1rem); margin-left: 1rem;" />
        <p>
          Of course this is a very simple approach. In the OOP version, each ConcreteCreator can grow as needed and so in functional approach.
          But I do believe that functional programming is just a matter of functions and composition of them and in the OOP, depending on the language,
          it gets messier and messier. At least for me, it's more easy to think and look for functions than hidden functions and such.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other devs say that the design patterns appears naturally but I disagree. I think they do appear but the underline mechanism is the reason for it.
          Others say function programming has their own complexity to grow and yes that is correct but the composition for it may need some effort in the beginning
          but once the mental model is acquired, everything becomes smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>
          but what the hell do I know? <em>I dunno what I'm doing</em>.

        <summary>Init blog ~ 2024.08.23 @ 19.25</summary>
        <p>
          I'm writing this with Macbook Pro 16in with 32GB. In the background I have Music app playing The Killers - Shot At the Night. 
          I'm using nvim as an editor and Warp as a terminal. It brings memories from the 90's when I took my first computer, a C64.
          I was only 5 years old. I knew shit about technology. I remember I saw my dad writing something. It was code. The music came
          from the radio. I was sitting at his side. What an image of how things have changes. My generation has lived the birth of so
          many great things. Today, however, I have reached a point in life that I'm wondering why the fucking fuck things got inexcusable
          complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apps in mobile crashing or slow. My laptop takes ages to start up. The amount of node modules is getting bigger and bigger that 
          I'm worried about the planet collapsing into a blackhole. Not even Thor's hammer weights so much. JESUS!
        </p>
        <p>
          On the internet constant stupid discussions about which one is better and inclusivity and so. I mean I understand we need space for
          creativity but for the love of Odin's beard where we draw the line!?
        </p>
        <p>
          How the fuck are we going to fix this? I was working on a project, a microservice architecture, that I kid you not there was no fucking
          need to make use of such architecture. It seems it was an overengineering mistake. Ain't no saint, I have made such errors too. The project
          was made with Ruby on Rails, a framework I left behind when I discovered Phoenix.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not a software engineer. I majored in physics, for better or worse. So when I learnt about functional programming, I have a stroke.
          Since that day, I have never looked back. This is painful, though. It's part of the reason of this <s>post</s> rant.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's been years I wanted to start a blog about my adventures in programming. But every time it was the same, what could I possible share of value?
          Today, I think, I have come to the conclusion but someone will find some value in this blog and what better with a rant about complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let us begin, then ^_^
